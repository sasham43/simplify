## About
This is intended to be a proof of concept for a user-interface redesign of Spotify's desktop application.  Built from the ground up, it offers streamlined functionality focused exclusively on long play albums and cover art.  However, if you have libspotify installed (for instance on Raspberry Pi), it can also stream music provided you have a Spotify Premium account.
